# Cloud-Native Monitoring App
This is a cloud-native monitoring application created in Python that helps users monitor their cloud resources on AWS. The app is built as a Docker image and stored in AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) for easy deployment and scalability.

Features
Monitoring of various AWS services such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, S3 buckets, and more
Real-time alerts for high CPU usage, low disk space, database connection errors, and other critical issues
Customizable dashboard with widgets to visualize resource utilization, network traffic, and other metrics
Integration with popular monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana
Deployment
This app is designed to be deployed on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for high availability and scalability. The Docker image is stored in AWS ECR and can be easily pulled by Kubernetes clusters running on EKS.

Getting Started
To run this app locally or on your own cloud infrastructure, you will need to have the following:

Python 3.8 or later
Docker
AWS account with ECR and EKS access
After cloning the repository, build the Docker image using the following command:

arduino
Copy code
docker build -t <image-name> .
Next, push the image to your AWS ECR repository:

php
Copy code
docker tag <image-name> <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<image-name>:<tag>
docker push <aws-account-id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<image-name>:<tag>
Finally, deploy the app to your EKS cluster using Kubernetes manifests provided in the kubernetes/ directory:

Copy code
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/
Once deployed, access the app at http://<load-balancer-address>.
